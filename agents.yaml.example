# - teams: (Optional) List of Agno Team definitions that group agents
#
# Agent Fields:
# - name: Unique identifier for the agent (required)

#
# How Teams Work (Agno):

# - Team leader coordinates based on member roles and task requirements
# - Teams can be nested (teams containing sub-teams)

# Notes:
# 1. Empty lists mean no agents/teams will be loaded by default
# 2. Copy this file to agents.yaml and customize for your needs
# 3. At least one agent must be defined for the hub to start
# 4. Teams are optional - agents can work independently
# 5. MCP servers will only start for agents with plugin_type defined
# 6. All agents share the same model by default (from .env)
# 7. Use model_override to assign different models to specific agents/teams
